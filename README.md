MyShop â€“ Java Shop Backend

A simple Java-based webshop backend built as a project during my Java education. Demonstrates core e-commerce functionalities like product management, customer orders, and data handling.

Features

- Add, update, remove, and list products  
- Create and manage customer orders  
- Calculate totals and track order status  
- Input validation and error handling  
- Console-based interaction (expandable to REST API)

Technologies Used

- Java  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Java Collections (e.g. Lists, Maps)  
- Optional: JDBC or file-based data storage  
- Input/output via console

How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alexandranimhagen/MyShop.git
Open the project in your Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse etc.)

Run the main class (e.g., Main.java)

Interact via console to manage products and orders

What I Learned
By building this project, I learned how to:

Model domain logic for products and customer interactions

Implement CRUD operations in a console application

Structure code with classes, methods, and OOP best practices

Validate user input and handle errors gracefully

This project was part of my Java training and demonstrates backend logic, data structuring, and shop functionalities
